Project Title: Paymaster

Paymaster Integration for dApps on Starknet Objective: To facilitate the widespread adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Starknet platform by implementing a Paymaster system. Overview: Our project aims to develop a Paymaster system that allows dApps on Starknet to subsidize transaction fees for their users. This initiative is designed to enhance user experience and foster greater engagement with dApps. 


Key Features: Transaction Fee Sponsorship: Enable dApps to sponsor transaction fees, thereby alleviating the cost burden from end-users. Token Flexibility for Gas Fees: Introduce the functionality to pay gas fees in various tokens, offering flexibility and convenience to users. Leveraging Account Abstraction (AA): Utilize the native Account Abstraction feature on Starknet to streamline the transaction process and provide a seamless user experience. 


Exploring Paymaster and AA Synergies: Investigate and develop innovative solutions that combine the capabilities of Paymasters and AA, potentially unlocking new use cases and efficiencies on the Starknet platform. Goal: Our ultimate aim is to enhance the functionality and accessibility of dApps on Starknet, making them more appealing and user-friendly, thereby driving their adoption and usage.
